/**
 * A {@link TemplateCallableModel} that progressively writes it result into the {@code out} object, instead of
 * returning a single result at the end of the execution. Some directives won't print anything, and you call them from
 * other side-effects, or do flow control (conditional execution or repetition of the nested content).
 * <p>
 * They are not called from expression context, but on the top-level (that is, directly embedded into the
 * static text). (If some future template language allows calling them from expression context, the printed output
 * will be captured, and will be the return value of the call. Depending on the output format of the directive, the
 * type of that value will be {@link TemplateMarkupOutputModel} or {@link String}.)
 * <p>
 * Example usage in a template: {@code <@my.menu style="foo" expand=true>...</@my.menu>},
 * {@code <@my.menuItem "Some title" icon="some.jpg" />}.
 * <p>
 * You can find utilities for implementing {@link TemplateDirectiveModel}-s in {@link CallableUtils}.

     *         The place (in a template, normally) where this directive was called from. Not {@code null}; in case the
     *         call is not from a template, you can use {@link NonTemplateCallPlace#INSTANCE} (or another {@link

     *         Environment)} can be used to execute the nested content (even if there's no nested content; then simply
     *         nothing happens).

     * @param env
     *         The current processing environment. Not {@code null} in general, though certain implementations may
     *         specifically allow that, typically, implementations that are just adapters towards FreeMarker-unaware
     *         callables (for example, {@link JavaMethodModel} is like that).
     *
     * @throws TemplateException
     *         If any problem occurs that's not an {@link IOException} during writing the template output.
     * @throws IOException
     *         When writing the template output fails.
